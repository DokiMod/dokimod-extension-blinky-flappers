# Blinky-Flappers-MOD
Blinky Flappers!,an unofficial DDLC fan-made mod which adds some face animations to all of the Dokis' sprites and CGs.
It includes modified definitions.rpy, cgs.rpy, splash.rpy, script-ch30.rpy,script-poemgame.rpy and modified face expression assets.
The algorithm of blinking and mouth-flapping is originally created by Renpy Tom and other Ren'py developers, and published in Ren'py community.
I only modified them and applied to DDLC.
Also mod-assets are originally drawn by Ms.Satchely.
I just modified them to fit to this mod.
Some assets are drawn by HAOTADO twitter@hadowater.
I have no copyright.
So feel free to use them in your own fan-mod or modify them.
No need to inform me or credit me.
